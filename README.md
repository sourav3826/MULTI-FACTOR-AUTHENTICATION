# Multifactor Authentication

This project implements a multifactor authentication system with two methods:

1. **QR Code Scanning using Google Authenticator**
2. **OTP on Number and Security Question**

## QR Code Scanning using Google Authenticator

### Description
This authentication method involves scanning a QR code generated by the server using Google Authenticator. The app generates time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs) for an additional layer of security.

### Implementation
- The server generates a unique QR code for each user.
- Users scan the QR code using the Google Authenticator app to set up two-factor authentication.
- The app generates OTPs that users must provide during the login process.

## OTP on Number and Security Question [python file]

### Description
This authentication method involves generating OTPs and asking security questions for verification.

### Implementation
- A Python script generates OTPs and sends them to the user's registered phone number.
- Users are also prompted to answer a security question (e.g., favorite color) during the login process.

### Files
 Python script for OTP generation and sending to the registered phone number.
 Python script for asking a security question.

### Usage
1. Run the website: Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Execute the Python scripts for OTP and security question.
